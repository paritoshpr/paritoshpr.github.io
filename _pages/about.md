I'm Paritosh, a 4th year PhD student in Computational Science and Engineering at the [School of Industrial and Systems Engineering at Georgia Tech](https://ww.isye.gatech.edu). 
I'm being co-advised by [Prof. Nagi Gebraeel](https://www2.isye.gatech.edu/people/faculty/Nagi_Gebraeel/) from Industrial Engineering and [Prof. Edmond Chow](https://www.edmondchow.com) from Computational Science. 
At Georgia Tech my research is on asynchronous solutions to large-scale decentralized optimization problems with applications to power systems, machine learning and linear solvers.

Updates
======

- **05/19** I'll be spending the summer in the Bay Area interning at NEC Labs of America under [Dr. Kiyoshi Nakayama](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~knakayam/). We are working on decentralized blockchain algorithms for large scale Federated Learning. Super excited!
- **05/19** I gave a talk on [Conflict Reduction and Deterrence in the Power Grid of the Future: A Cyber Security Perspective](files/SNSPSpringPresentation.pdf) at the United States Special Operations Command Centre in Tampa, FL as a Sam Nunn Fellow. 
- **04/19** I finally defended my Ph.D proposal. Officially a PhD candidate!
- **05/18** I was awarded the Sam Nunn Fellowship for the academic year 2018-2019. My department also did a [feature article](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/news/isye-phd-student-paritosh-ramanan-selected-2018-sam-nunn-security-fellow) on my fellowship.


My prior life!
======

Prior to joining Georgia Tech, I got my Masters degree with a [thesis](https://scholarworks.gsu.edu/cs_theses/81/) in Computer Science from Georgia State University in Spring 2015.
At Georgia State, I worked with [Prof. Wenzhan Song](http://sensorweb.engr.uga.edu/index.php/song/) on developing INDIGO, a distributed gossip framework for seismic tomography. 
We also did some interesting stuff applying concepts of seismic ray tracing to wireless mesh network for anomaly detection.

We also deployed our sensors on the Llaima volcano in southern Chile. 
The Geo Sciences department at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill covered our field deployment. You can read it [here](http://endeavors.unc.edu/llaima_volcano_expedition).


My prior prior life!
======

Before I started at Georgia State, I went to BITS-Pilani, Goa where I did my Bachelors in Information Systems. As an undergrad, I did some research in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) under [Dr. Sreejith V](http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/srev/profile).
