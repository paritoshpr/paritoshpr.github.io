title: "[Bitcoins:A survey and comparison of parallel techniques](../files/paritosh_ramanan_survey_3rd.pdf)"
excerpt: "As part of the course project in *CSC8530 Parallel Algorithms* at Georgia State, I wrote a survey paper on BITCOINS.

I was interested in unravelling how it all works and explore the parallel and distributed computing perspectives for Proof-of-Work.

This was back in 2014 when BITCOINS were still at $700 a pop! Miss those days! :D
